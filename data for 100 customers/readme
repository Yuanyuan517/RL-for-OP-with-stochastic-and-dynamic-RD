There are two folders:

1. Static_release_dates: here you have files with node coordinates. Each file of CR101 is created by combining files from C101 and RC101 (C101_0.5 and RC101_0.5, C101_1 and RC101_1, C101_1.5 and RC101_1.5) from Solomon instances (Solomon, 1987).

2. Dynamic_release_dates: here you have the data related to the estimated release dates named as instance_δ_I_β.dat.csv. Time is discretized in time units. You should read these files as follows:
Each row corresponds to a time unit. The first number of each row is the ID of the time unit (you will notice that it is constantly increasing by one). The following numbers on each row report, for each node starting from 0 (depot) to 100 (maximum size we considered), the expected value and the variance of the release date. You will notice that the first two numbers are always 0 as they are associated with the depot. When the variance of a node is 0 it means that the package reached the depot (either in the current time period or earlier). Please use this variance to find the actual release date of each customer (rather than the ones in the folder Static_release_dates).
